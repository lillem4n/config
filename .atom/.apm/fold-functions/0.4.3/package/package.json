{"name":"fold-functions","main":"./lib/fold-functions","version":"0.4.3","description":"Toggle folding on all functions","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/robballou/atom-fold-functions.git"},"license":"MIT","engines":{"atom":">=0.174.0 <2.0.0"},"dependencies":{},"readme":"# Fold Functions\n\nFolds functions within your code. Currently comes with a toggle, fold, and unfold option that will look for functions marked with 'meta.function'. Handy because it won't fold things like comments associated with functions.\n\n![screenshot](http://robballou.com/i/fold.gif)\n\n*Note: this currently folds only those functions it finds at a single indentation (e.g. it will fold the top level functions)*\n\nHeavily inspired/influnced by [Fold Comments](https://atom.io/packages/fold-comments).\n\n## Autofolding\n\nYou can turn on the auto-folding feature with the following in your configuration file:\n\n```coffescript\n\"fold-functions\":\n    autofold: true\n    shortfileCutoff: 42\n    autofoldGrammars: []\n    autofoldIgnoreGrammars: ['SQL', 'CSV', 'JSON', 'CSON', 'Plain Text']\n```\n\nBy default, this is setup to ignore files that are under 42 lines. This can be configured by changing the `shortfileCutoff` option to a larger or smaller number. If you wish to fold all files, even short ones, you can change this option to `0`.\n\nAdditionally, two new autofolding options have been added in 0.4.2:\n\n1. `autofoldGrammars` allows you to specify grammar names for grammars you *want* to autofold. An empty list (which is the default), means everything is fair game to fold. That is except...\n2. `autofoldIgnoreGrammars` allows you to specify grammar names for grammars you *do not want to autofold*. This fires after `autofoldGrammars` and does have a default value (see above).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/robballou/atom-fold-functions/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/robballou/atom-fold-functions#readme","_id":"fold-functions@0.4.3","_shasum":"5cd45eeccfcde2193c73779d99aa075916c37698","_resolved":"file:../d-116516-8427-dklsyi/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116516-8427-dklsyi/package.tgz"}
